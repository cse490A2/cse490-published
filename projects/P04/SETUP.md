# **Project 4 setup guide**

This document sets up your computer for CSE490’s in-class projects. There are two ways to do it, and they end in the same place. Pick one.

## **Option 1: the wizard (recommended)**

A small program that walks you through each step, with a picture of where to click, and checks each one on your computer. Download it once; every week it fetches that week’s project by itself. Requires Python 3.9+.  
Download [wizard-cse490.zip](https://github.com/cse490A2/cse490-published/releases/download/wizard/wizard-cse490.zip). It lands in your Downloads folder.

### **Mac**

Double-click the zip in Downloads to get the wizard folder. Then, in Terminal:  
`cd ~/Downloads/wizard`  
`python3 wizard.py`

### **Windows**

Right-click the zip in Downloads, choose "Extract All", open the wizard folder it makes, and double-click SETUP-WINDOWS.bat. If the blue "Windows protected your PC" box appears: "More info", then "Run anyway".

## **Option 2: by hand**

Read the section for your computer below (Mac, Windows or Linux) and do each step yourself. The steps are the same ones the wizard walks.

## **Mac**

### **1\. Project 4 folder**

Make your Project 4 folder as a copy of your Project 3 folder: copy the folder that holds harness.py and systemprompt.md, name the copy p04, and open the copy in VS Code (File, then Open Folder). Project 4 goes on in the copy, so this week's files replace copies and your Project 3 work stays as it was. If harness.py is gone, unzip your P03-submission.zip and move harness.py into the new folder. With no submission to go back to, the Project 3 starter ([starter.zip](https://github.com/cse490A2/cse490-published/raw/main/projects/P03/starter.zip)) gives you the pseudocode harness to finish first.

### **2\. Project 4 files**

Download [starter.zip](https://github.com/cse490A2/cse490-published/raw/main/projects/P04/starter.zip) and unzip it. Move everything inside the unpacked starter folder into your Project 4 folder, replacing systemprompt.md and the logs folder when asked: they are the copies from Project 3, and Project 3's own stay in its folder. On a Mac, Replace swaps the whole logs folder for the starter's, which holds only the switch file for Project 4; this week's chat log starts fresh there, and your Project 3 log stays in p03. On Windows and Linux only the switch file is replaced.

### **3\. Tidy the folder**

Make a folder named project3 inside your Project 4 folder and move Project 3's files into it: inventory.py, utils.py, test\_utils.py and any other tests from Project 3, stats.py, stats.js, scores.csv, harness\_testbench.md and the untangle folder. This week's files stay at the top: harness.py, systemprompt.md, `.env`, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, the logs, skills, tests and articles folders, SPEC.md, CHECK and questions.csv. Delete nothing.

### **4\. Course key**

Your Project 4 folder holds `.env` with your course key, copied from Project 3\. Open it and check that it still has these two lines:  
`LITELLM_BASE_URL=https://llmproxy.cs.washington.edu`  
`LITELLM_API_KEY=<your key here>`  
with your key in place of \<your key here\> (it starts with sk). If the file is missing or the key line is empty, make the file again: in VS Code, right-click the empty space in the Explorer, choose New File, name it exactly `.env`, and paste the two lines in.

### **5\. AI chat in VS Code**

In VS Code, click the Extensions icon in the bar on the far left: four squares. Or press Cmd+Shift+X.  
act: tap=icon  
Search for LiteLLM. Install "LiteLLM Provider for GitHub Copilot Chat" by Vivswan.  
act: type=search "LiteLLM" · tap=install  
   
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cse490A2/cse490-published/main/projects/P04/images/setup-1.png)  
Open the Command Palette with Cmd+Shift+P. Run "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)".  
act: tap=palette  
Add this entry inside the outer braces:  
`"litellm-vscode-chat.servers": [`  
    `{`  
        `"label": "CSE 490",`  
        `"baseUrl": "https://llmproxy.cs.washington.edu",`  
        `"auth": { "apiKey": "<your key here>" }`  
    `}`  
`]`  
Replace \<your key here\> with your API key. Save the file.  
This week the AI answers in chat and you type every change yourself. Add this line beside the entry, with a comma between them, and save:  
`"chat.agent.enabled": false`  
Open the chat panel: the speech-bubble icon at the top, or Ctrl+Cmd+I. The model picker at the bottom of the chat box reads Auto. Leave it on Auto: that is the mode this project uses. Do not pick a model from the list. If the picker asks you to sign in to GitHub first, sign in.

### **6\. Course extension**

Download the course extension, cse490-tools.vsix, from https://github.com/cse490A2/cse490-published/releases/latest/download/cse490-tools.vsix (download it again if you installed it before October 26: version 0.5.5 or newer can say why a chat log stays empty). In VS Code, open the Extensions panel, open the three-dots menu at the top, choose "Install from VSIX...", and pick the downloaded file. It starts once your project files are in place; the chat log step covers that.

### **7\. Chat log**

In VS Code, open your project folder itself (File, then Open Folder, then p04), not the folder above it: the Explorer's top entry must read P04. Then restart VS Code's extensions (the "Restart Extensions" button at the top of the Extensions panel, or "Developer: Reload Window" from the Command Palette). The status bar reads "Chat log: 0 turns" when the extension is running. Send the model one message in the chat panel and wait half a minute: the status bar should read "Chat log: 1 turn", and every chat with the course models is then saved to logs/\_chatlog.md in your project folder. If it stays at 0 turns, run "CSE 490: Why is my chat log empty?" from the Command Palette: it writes logs/\_chatlog-doctor.txt and says what it found; post that file on Ed and go on with the project, since the grader also reads your chats from the course gateway's record of your key.

### **8\. Harness check**

In VS Code, choose Terminal, then New Terminal. It opens in your Project 4 folder.  
act: tap=item  
Run:  
`python3 harness.py`  
It waits for your first message. If it stops with an error before that, read the last line of the error: a missing package names itself, and an "invalid key" means `.env` is wrong (the Course key step puts it right).  
Type my name is Sam and press Enter. Then type spell my name backwards and press Enter. A reply with maS means the harness keeps the conversation between turns. A reply that does not know the name means it sends only the latest message: go back to the chatbot loop in the Reference of the Project 3 handout.  
Type read SPEC.md and tell me what it says, and press Enter. A reply that quotes the file means the read tool from Project 3 is there. Press Ctrl+C to stop the harness.

## **Windows**

### **1\. Project 4 folder**

Make your Project 4 folder as a copy of your Project 3 folder: copy the folder that holds harness.py and systemprompt.md, name the copy p04, and open the copy in VS Code (File, then Open Folder).
