# Project 4 Submission

Push your harness repository to GitHub and submit its link to the Project 4 assignment in Canvas. Compare the repository with the tree below first. Leave out your .env file and the articles folder.

## What the repository holds

* harness.py  
* systemprompt.md  
* PLAN.md and profile.json  
* skills/plan-mode/SKILL.md and skills/coding-loop/SKILL.md  
* pedia.py and tests/  
* transcript.md  
* logs/, the chat log VS Code kept

## What each file is

* harness.py: your Project 3 harness after the handout's changes: the skills scan at startup, the match on each message, and the hook that runs the score after every write.  
* systemprompt.md: the starter's five parts with your two rules under Your rules.  
* PLAN.md: the plan your agent wrote last, before you typed approve. profile.json: your answers from plan mode, which pedia.py reads.  
* skills/: the two skills as the starter shipped them, unchanged.  
* pedia.py and tests/: the encyclopedia your agent built, as its last write left them.  
* transcript.md: the sections your agent appended, one per job: the decision, the questions and answers, the plan, the approve, every file it wrote, every score line, the report.  
* logs/: the record of your prompts to the LiteLLM chat. Leave it as it is.

## What to leave out

Your .env file and the articles folder. The grader has the articles; a key anywhere in the repository costs the rules check and is reported to you by name.
